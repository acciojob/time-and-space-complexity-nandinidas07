	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p><b>Time Complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It gives us an idea of how the algorithm scales with the size of the input.</b></p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs.</b> </p>
